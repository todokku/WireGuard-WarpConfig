Install WireGuard on Linux as normaly !

Add the Wireguard repository to your sources list. 
Apt will then automatically update the package cache.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard

Install Wireguard. The wireguard package will install all necessary dependencies.

sudo apt install wireguard

Create the file /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

You will need to run Folder menager or nautilus as root
for that write:

sudo nautilus

Locate the file /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf if you haven't created it yet, 
create it with the text redactor and paste it in /etc/wireguard/ named as wg0.conf

Inside put the content of WARP-identity.conf generated file, made a new one under Windows to use on linux.
When you have taken the content of WARP-identity.conf as your new wg0.conf at the location /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
before you save it, remove the DNS settings line: DNS 1.1.1.1 
then it should look like this: 

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <private key>
Address = <ip4 ip address>
Address = <ip6 ip Adress/port>

[Peer]
PublicKey = <public key>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
AllowedIPs = ::/0
Endpoint = engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408

Then Set Up Firewall Rules

    Allow SSH connections and WireGuardâ€™s VPN port:

    sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
    sudo ufw enable

    Verify the settings:

    sudo ufw status verbose

Start the Wireguard Service

    Start Wireguard:

    wg-quick up wg0

        
		Note
 To turn off the wg0 interface with write:
 wg-quick down wg0

    Enable the Wireguard service to automatically restart on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
    
    if you need to turn it off
    
    sudo systemctl disable wg-quick@wg0

    Check if the VPN tunnel is running with the following two commands:

    sudo wg show
	
If you see the connection details. with it's last handshake.
all is fine, you should have encrypted connection working under linux,
with WireGuad tied directly with the linux kernel, so system wide based.
